             description: "Galactose is a monosaccharide hexose that is made from the catabolism of lactose into galactose and glucose. \n\nReactivity: Galactose undergoes phosphorylation by galactokinase, and then galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase and an epimerase finish the conversion of galactose to glucose."),

             description: "After galactose is formed from the catabolism of lactose into galactose and glucose, galactose is converted into glucose so that it can enter the glycolytic pathway for energy production. Galactose is converted to glucose via galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, and finally an epimerase to convert the molecule from the galactose epimer to the glucose epimer."),
        4 : (title: "Glucose",
             description: "Glucose is a monosaccharide hexose. The body tries to maintain homeostatic levels of blood glucose at about 5.5 mM (100 mg/dL).\n\nSynthesis: Blood glucose can be introduced by -\n(1) the breakdown of disaccharide sugars: sucrose, lactose, and maltose catabolism for example, will all yield glucose monomers\n(2) glycogenolysis: during the post-absorptive state, the initial response of decreasing blood sugar is for the liver to start catabolizing glycogen reserves to release glucose into the blood stream\n(3) gluconeogenesis: the brain largely prefers glucose as a source of energy. As a result if blood glucose levels run low, the liver and renal cortex will compensate by performing gluconeogenesis and releasing the newly formed glucose to the blood\n(4) uptake from serum: hepatocytes and pancreatic islet beta cells have a GLUT2 low-affinity glucose receptor such that they uptake glucose proportional to the serum level. On the other hand, adipocytes and muscle cells have a GLUT4 high-affinity glucose receptor such that they import glucose whenever available.\n\nReactivity: Glucose is first phosphorylated at carbon 6 to form glucose-6-phosphate. This phosphorylation attaches a negatively charged phosphate group to the sugar, which prevents it from escaping the cell. This phosphorylation essentially traps the molecule in the cell, pushing the equilibrium toward the products of the downstream catabolic pathway."),
        5 : (title: "GK/HK",
             description: "The glucokinase and hexokinase enzymes phosphorylate carbon-6 of glucose molecules in the cell in an irreversible reaction that uses one ATP equivalent. This phosphorylation attaches a negatively charged phosphate to the sugar molecule to trap the glucose in the cell because GLUT transporters are specific for glucose not phosphorylated glucose.\n\nHexokinase is in all tissues and is inhibited by the glucose-6-phosphate product. Hexokinase has a low Km, which implies that it has maximum catalytic activity at low glucose concentration. Glucokinase, on the other hand, is exclusively in liver cells pancreatic beta islet cells and is induced by insulin. Glucokinase acts as glucose sensor along with GLUT2 as it has a high Km, yielding activity proportional to glucose concentration."),
        6 : (title: "G6Pase",
             description: "The glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme is an irreversible enzyme that converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. This enzyme is inhibited by insulin, such that it will be active only during gluconeogenesis. This irreversible enzyme finishes the recreation of glucose during gluconeogenesis, and it is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in hepatocytes. Glucose-6-phosphate is transported to the ER lumen and then glucose is transported back to cytoplasm where it can diffuse out of the cell using GLUT transporters. Absence of glucose-6-phosphatase in skeletal muscle means muscle glycogen cannot serve as a source of blood glucose."),
        7 : (title: "G6P",
             description: "Glucose-6-phosphate is the molecule formed after phosphorylation of carbon-6 on glucose. Unlike unphosphorylated glucose, G6P cannot escape from the cell through the GLUT transporters. Thus, following this phosphorylation, G6P will follow one of the catabolic or anabolic pathways (unless gluconeogenesis is being performed in the hepatocytes where G6P can be dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase to yield a glucose monomer which can be subsequently released from the cell).\n\nReactivity: G6P can proceed down a catabolic pathway or one of two anabolic pathways. The catabolism of G6P proceeds via glycolysis (G6P is broken down to form ATP and NADH). The first anabolic option for G6P is glycogenesis, where G6P is used to make the storage form of glucose: glycogen. The second anabolic option for G6P is a shunt from glycolytic flux: the Pentose Phosphate Pathway. This pathway produces NADPH for intracellular reductive chemistry and ribose sugars for nucleotide synthesis during cell growth."),
        8 : (title: "G6P-DH",
             description: "The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme is the rate-determining step in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The enzyme converts some of the glucose-6-phosphate that would typically go down the glycolytic pathway into ribulose-5-phosphate and NADPH. The ribulose-5-phosphate can be converted into the ribose nucleotide precursor via further chemistry. The NADPH product serves a very important purpose within the cell. While NADH is almost immediately oxidized by the electron transport chain in the mitochondria causing its levels to remain low intracellularly, NADPH retains high intracellular levels. Thus, instead of being used for energy, NADPH can be used for intracellular reductive chemistry such as the glutathionine antioxidant functionality.\n\nControl: Because G6P-DH is the rate-determining step in the PPP, control over the flux into PPP largely occurs here. Insulin activates the enzyme - as expected, when energy is high in the cell, the cell can contribute more G6P toward growth and nucleotide synthesis. Furthermore, the pathway experiences negative feedback where the NADPH product inhibits the pathway and the NADP+ reactant activates the enzyme."),

Note that this step is irreversible and a different enzyme is required for glycogenolysis.\n\nControl: Glycogen synthase is the rate-limiting step in glycogenesis so much control occurs here. Glycogen synthase is activated by insulin as we would expect - we want to store excess glucose as glycogen after the cell is energetically satisfied. In the liver, glucagon inhibits the enzyme activity so that the liver does not perform glycogenesis during energetic starvation. AMP, which is present in high concentrations during energetic starvation, inhibits glycogen synthase in the muscle. Epinephrine, a hormone that attempts to acutely increase blood glucose levels in response to stress (i.e. fight or flight response), inhibits glycogen synthase in both the liver and the muscle."),

              description: "Alpha-1,4-glycogen is the storage form of glucose. It is a straight chain of glucose monomers in this unbranched form. Liver glycogen is broken down to maintain constant blood glucose level. Muscle glycogen is broken down to provide glucose to the muscle during exercise. Glycogen is stored in the cellular cytoplasm as granules. Each granule has a protein core with polyglucose chains radiating outward to form a sphere. Linear chains have highest density of glucose near center. Branched chains have highest density at periphery (allowing a more rapid release of glucose on demand). The 1,4 form of glycogen is unbranched."),

              description: "The irreversible branching enzyme converts alpha-1,4-glycogen to alpha-1,6-glycogen, thus adding a branch to the glycogen chain. Branched glycogen has higher density at the periphery of the spherical granule, allowing for a more rapid release of glucose on demand."),

              description: "Alpha-1,6-glycogen is the branched connection form in the storage form of glucose: glycogen. This branched bond allows the spherical glycogen granules to have a higher density at the periphery, allowing for a more rapid release of glucose on demand."),
        20 : (title: "Debranching",
              description: "The debranching enzyme is used to catalyze the hydrolysis of the branches in a glycogen granule chain. The first alpha-1-4 bond after an alpha-1-6 bond is cleaved by the enzyme and that released chain is reattached to the end of the other accompanying glycogen strand. Then, the remaining monomer after the alpha-1-6 bond is cleaved off, leaving a glucose monomer and an alpha-1-4 glycogen strand that can be cleaved per normal catabolic reactivity."),

              description: "Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the conversion of alpha-1-4-glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate. This catabolic step breaks down to glycogen into its glucose monomers such that the glucose can be broken down to form energy for the cell.\n\nControl: This is the rate-determining step of glycogenolysis, and it is under hormonal control. Intuitively, insulin and ATP, signs of high energy, inhibit glycogen phosphorylase. On the other hand, glucagon activates the enzyme in the liver and AMP and epinephrine activate the enzyme in muscle. The enzyme is activated under signs of a low-energy environment such that energy stores can be catabolized."),

This isomerization essentially pops another alcohol group out of the ring where it is separated from the core sugar ring by one intermediate carbon. When the alcohol group is separated from the ring, it can be phosphorylated downstream (in fact in the next step catalyzed by PFK)."),

The product fructose-2,6-bisphosphate activates phosphofructokinase-1. Because phosphofructokinase-2 is activated by insulin, hepatocytes can override the ATP inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 via insulinâs activation of phosphofructokinase-2 and subsequent activation of phosphofructokinase-1. Thus, hepatocytes can continue to run glycolysis to generate metabolic precursors even if they are energetically satisfied.\n\nControl: Phosphofructokinase-2 is under liver hormonal control. It is activated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon. Thus, insulin will override the typical ATP inhibition of glycolysis in hepatocytes."),
        25 : (title: "F-2,6-BP",
              description: "Fructose-2-6-bisphosphate is a phosphorylated product of fructose-6-phosphate produced by liver hepatocytes that cannot proceed to downstream glycolytic catabolism. Instead, its function is to activate the phosphofructokinase-1 enzyme. Because PFK-1 is inhibited by ATP, hepatocytes can activate PFK-2 in the presence of insulin to generate F-2,6-BP and activate PFK-1. Thus, in the presence of insulin, hepatocytes can override the ATP inhibition of glycolysis and use insulin to continue generating metabolic precursors even if theyâre energetically satisfied."),

              description: "Phosphofructokinase-1 phosphorylates fructose-6-phosphate to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate in an irreversible reaction that uses one ATP equivalent. This step of the reaction separates the prep and payoff phases of glycolysis. In the prep phase, energy is put in to phosphorylate a glucose monomer. Before the end of the prep phase, the glucose monomer can go down several pathways, including glycolysis, the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, and glycogenesis. However after the phosphofructokinase-1 irreversible step, the resulting fructose-1,6-bisphosphate molecule will finish glycolysis and be converted to pyruvate. The payoff phase results in energy extraction from the phosphorylated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate molecule.\n\nControl: Phosphofructokinase-1 is the rate-limiting step in glycolysis, so much control of the entire glycolytic pathway occurs here. When the cell is energetically satisfied and ATP or citrate are present, phosphofructokinase-1 is inhibited. However, during the low-energy state, AMP activates the enzyme. More control over phosphofructokinase-1 occurs via phosphofructokinase-2 in the liver, see PFK-2 for more details."),

              description: "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is the turning point between the prep phase and the payoff phase of glycolysis. After fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is generated, the glycolysis pathway will be followed because the phosphofructokinase-1 step to generate frutocse-1,6-bisphosphate is irreversible."),

              description: "Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase splits fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone-phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GADP) in a reversible retro-aldol reaction. This lysing releases to phosphorylated molecules so that neither can escape from the cell. The two released molecules will be further catabolized in glycolysis to extract energy."),

The dihydroxyacetone-phosphate piece does cannot directly proceed down further catabolic glycolysis reactions but must first be converted to the other product of the aldolase splitting: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. However, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate also forms a precursor for the glycerol-3-phosphate backbone of triglycerides, so it can proceed down that anabolic pathway as well. Dihydroxyacetone-phosphate is the pathway by which fructose enters glycolysis. Because fructose enters glycolysis after the main phosphofructokinase-1 control point, fructose will be largely catabolized regardless of the energetic necessities of the cell. Thus, fructose will provide a spike of energy even if the cell is already energetically satisfied."),

              description: "Fructose is a hexose isomer of glucose that can be generated by the catabolism of the sucrose disaccharide. Fructose is catabolized to enter glycolysis for energy extraction, except instead of entering glycolysis at the normal glucose entry point like glucose and galactose, fructose enters downstream. Because, fructose enters the glycolytic pathway after the main glycolysis phosphofructokinase-1 control point, fructose is quickly catabolized, regardless of the energetic needs of the cell. Thus, fructose will result in an ATP spike even if the cell is energetically satisfied."),

              description: "The glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle is a method of transporting reduced energy carrier into the mitochondria and also generates the glycerol-3-phosphate backbone of triglycerides (the storage unit for fatty acids in the cell). In the shuttle, one NADH equivalent is used to convert dihydroxyacetone-phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate and NAD+. The glycerol-3-phosphate unit can then be used as a backbone for triglyceride synthesis. In addition, glycerol-3-phosphate can enter the mitochondria, where it can react with FAD+ to regenerate dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and an additional FADH2. This shuttle thus essentially transfers an NADH from the cytoplasm to an FADH2 in the mitochondrial matrix, while also generating the glycerol-3-phosphate intermediate which can be used for triglyceride synthesis."),

              description: "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the redox substrate-level phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and NAD+ to 1-3-bisphosphoglycerate and NADH. The NADH generated in this step is not directly used in glycolysis but can be transported to the mitochondria via either the glyerol-3-phosphate shuttle or the malate-aspartate shuttle for energy extraction in the electron transport chain. However, if oxygen is not present, the electron transport chain will not run and NADH will accumulate. Thus, the cell will run out of the NAD+ necessary for this step of glycolysis. Thus, NAD+ can be regenerated in anaerobic conditions. This NAD+ regeneration forms lactic acid from pyruvate (the final glycolysis product) in humans and ethanol from pyruvate in bacteria and yeast. Note that although this step includes a phosphorylation, ATP is not used. Thus, when the phosphate group is removed from 1,3-BPG to form ATP, new energy is being formed (this was not the case with previous phosphorylations as ATP was being used). As a result, 2 ATP and 2 NADH will be generated per glucose molecule in glycolysis (1 ATP and 1 NADH per piece following the aldolase split)."),

To regenerate the NAD+ oxidizing equivalent, fermentation will take place. In fermentation in humans, pyruvate is oxidized to lactic acid, and NAD+ is reduced back to NADH in a redox reaction. In bacteria and yeast, a similar redox reaction occurs but ethanol is formed instead of lactic acid.\n(3)During energy deprivation, gluconeogenesis in the liver and renal cortex stabilize blood glucose levels.

Malate can then enter the mitochondrial matrix. Once inside, malate dehydrogenase can catalyze the reverse reaction to convert malate and NAD+ to oxaloacetate and NADH. Subsequently, oxaloacetate and glutamate are converted to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate in the mitochondrial matrix by aspartate transaminase.
