             description: "Glucose is a monosaccharide hexose. The body tries to maintain homeostatic levels of blood glucose at about 5.5 mM (100 mg/dL).\n\nSynthesis: Blood glucose can be introduced by -\n(1) the breakdown of sugars: fructose, galactose, maltose, and sucrose catabolism for example, will all yield glucose monomers\n(2) glycogenolysis: during the post-absorptive state, the intial response of decreasing blood suguar is for the liver to start catabolizing glycogen reserves to release glucose into the blood stream\n(3) gluconeogenesis: the brain largely prefers glucose as a source of energy. As a result if blood glucose levels run low, the liver and renal cortex will compensate by performing gluconeogenesis and releasing the newly formed glucose to the blood\n(4) uptake from serum: hepatocytes and pancreatic islet beta cells have a GLUT2 low-affinity glucose receptor such that they uptake glucose proportional to the serum level, on the other hand adipocytes and muscle cells have a GLUT4 high-affinity glucose receptor such that they import glucose whenever available.\n\nReactivity: Glucose "),
